# NLP Project 1

Spring 22. Done with Gal Katz.

In this project we wroked with the ATIS dataset and given a query our task was to predict the answer type.

First we verified our majority baseline, which was about 70%.

Later, we implemeted three methods to deal with the task and compared those in the terms of performance, optimization, and computation time:
1. Naive bayes classfier with delta-smoothing.
2. Logistice regression (also known as one-layer MLP).
3. Fully Connected Feedforward neural network, "FC-FFNN" (also known as multi-layer MLP).
