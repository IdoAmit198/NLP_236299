We concatenate these two states and use the result to initialize the corresponding layer of the decoder. (In the example, we concatenate $h_{0,4}$ and $h_{0,4}'$ to initialize layer 0, and we concatenate $h_{1,4}$ and $h_{1,4}'$ to initialize layer 1.)

        "Beam search decoding is the most commonly used decoding method in sequence-to-sequence approaches. Like greedy decoding, it uses a left-to-right search process. But instead of only keeping the single argmax at each position, beam search maintains the $K$ best partial hypotheses $H_t = \\{(y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_t^{(k)}): k\\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}\\}$ at every step $t$. To proceed to $t+1$, we compute the scores of sequences  $y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_t^{(k)}, y_{t+1}$ for every possible extension $y_{t+1}\\in \\mathcal{V}$ and every possible prefix $(y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_t^{(k)}) \\in H_t$, where $\\mathcal{V}$ is the vocabulary. Among these $K\\times |\\mathcal{V}|$ sequences, we only keep the top $K$ sequences with the best partial scores, and that becomes $H_{t+1} = \\{(y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_{t+1}^{(k)}): k\\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}\\}$. To start at $t=1$, $H_1 = \\{(y): y \\in \\text{K-argmax}_{y_1\\in\\mathcal{V}} \\log P(y_1|y_0=bos) \\}$. Here $K$ is called the beam size.\n",

        "_For state space Q and sequence length T, assuming the one step of decoding is done in $O(1)$ the time complexity of beam-search with size k is $O(K\\cdot Q \\cdot T)$, while the time complexity of the viterbi is $O(Q^2\\cdot T)$. About space complexity, beam-search at each step expand each of the K's beams to the whole state space $Q$, and taking the top-k, meaning at each step we use $O(K\\cdot Q)$ space (which we can free at the end of the step). In addition, we keep the paths of the top-k beams which cost $O(K\\cdot T)$. Total space complexity for beam-search is $O(K\\cdot Q+K\\cdot T)$. As for viterbi, we already saw the space complexity is just keeping the whole table, $O(Q\\cdot T)$._\n",
        "\n",
        "_The pros of beam search are it is faster to compute, much more scalable for huge state space (like in machine translation) and is flexible since we can tune our K hyper-parameter. Its' con is that it is not guarantee to find the best path (as we already mentioned before). On the other hand, viterbi algorithm is guarantee to find the best solution, but require more compute time and hard to scale in case our state space, $Q$ is large._"
