# Labs

First of all I want to give credit to Dr. Yonatan Belinkov and the great two TAs, Hadas and Shaked. I want to also give credit to my awesome partners along the labs.

Every lab folder consist of the notebook (instructions and implementation), the requirements file and basic sanity tests given by the course staff.

Partners along the way:

Labs 1: Barak Galanz

Labs 2: Matan Beigel

Labs 3: Yaniv Wolf

Labs 4: Shachar Katz
